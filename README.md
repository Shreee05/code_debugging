Project complete‚úÖ.

In my just-concluded project from Innomatics Research Labs, I identified issues and bugs affecting the functionality of a note-taking app called 'Scribble'. This project borders on the intersection between web applications, especially backend systems, and the world of data science.

Context‚úç

A team of enthusiastic data scientists identified a need to develop a personalized note-taking application. 

To build this, they have to utilize the Python, HTML, and Flask frameworks to create the application server. While at the development stage, the team ran into some challenges with the backend, which prevented it from being fully functional. Recognizing my proficiency in backend development, I have been tasked with fixing the broken code to ensure the application works seamlessly.

How is it supposed to work?

The Scribble app is expected to have a home page containing a text field and a button, such that when users add a note, they can see all the notes displayed as a list below the text field on the same page.
